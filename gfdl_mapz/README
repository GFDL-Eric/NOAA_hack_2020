omp : original code
acc : rearranged loop and partially implemented openacc.


To compile
  need access to nvhpc stack, NetCDF, and HDF5

  modify nvhpc.mk, as needed

  cd exec.omp
  make OPENMP=Y

  cd exec.acc
  make OPENACC=ON


To execute:
  Need to get input data from ftp://ftp.gfdl.noaa.gov/pub/Rusty.Benson/fv_mapz_data.nc
  cd rundir

  OMP_NUM_THREADS=<N> ../exec.omp/fv_mapz.x

  ../exec.acc/fv_mapz.x


On an internal system with Intel Xeon E5-2637 (3.50GHz) and two NVidia V100 Tesla GPUs
   1th OMP: 28.31s
   8th OMP:  5.22s
       ACC:  3.14s

No attempts have been made to optimize the compiler options for OpenMP or OpenACC
